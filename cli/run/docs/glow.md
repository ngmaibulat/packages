- 11;rgb:1e1e/1e1e/1e1e;1R

'\x1B]11;?\x1B\\\x1B[6n' is a valid, though somewhat unusual, combination of escape sequences. Let's break it down:

\x1B]11;?\x1B\\: This part is related to setting the window title or icon text.

\x1B] (or \033], or ^[) starts an OSC (Operating System Command) sequence.
11 is the parameter for setting the icon text and window title.
? is the actual text to be set (in this case, a question mark).
\x1B\\ (or \033\, or ^G) is the terminator for the OSC sequence.
\x1B[6n: This is a Device Status Report (DSR) sequence.

\x1B[ starts a CSI (Control Sequence Introducer) sequence.
6n is the code for DSR. This sequence requests the terminal to report its current cursor position. The terminal responds with another escape sequence that encodes the row and column number.
